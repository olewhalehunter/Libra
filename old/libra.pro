/* Consulting this small file loads Libra for Open Prolog on the Mac.  After loading, type 'libra.' to start Libra's command loop.Libra is implemented in four modules because Open Prolog can't edit files longer than 32K bytes.  It assumes that the files are in the start up folder.Briefly, 'parser' parses Libra programs, 'commands' responds to user commands, 'built_in' implements built-in operators and relations, and 'apply' applies relations to arguments.*/:-[-parser].:-[-commands].:-[-built_in].:-[-apply].
